# **Dining-Philosophers** #
This project introduces fundamental concepts of **multithreading**, **synchronization** and concurrency, It simulates the famous ***dining philosophers problem***, which explores **resource allocation**, **deadlocks**, and **race conditions** in concurrent programming.

#### **Project Goal :** #### 
The goal of the project is to implement a simulation where a group of philosophers alternates between three states: `Thinking`, `Eating` and `Sleeping`, Each philosopher must acquire ***two forks*** (shared resources) to eat, ensuring proper synchronization to prevent ***deadlocks*** and ***starvation***.
